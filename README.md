# cards
The purpose of this project was to help me understand the concept of object oriented programming and to attempt something I found difficult as a beginner of Python.  Innitially, the goal of the project was to create a deck of cards.  After accomplishing this the next step was to deal a hand to the user and then finally apply the rules of Poker to the program.  This iteration of the program is still somewhat unpolished and could be written a little more efficiently.  I'm am editing it as I attempt new projects and learn new techniques. 
## Creating the Deck
```
class Card:
    def __init__(self, suit):
        self.suit = suit
        self.number = 0

    def get_number(self):
        self.number = self.assign_value()
        new_card = str(self.number) + ' of ' + str(self.suit)
        return new_card


class Deck(Card):
    def __init__(self, suit):
        Card.__init__(self, suit)

    def assign_value(self):
        new_card = randint(1, 13)
        if new_card == 1:
            new_card = 'ace'
          ...
        return new_card

    def create_deck(self):
        number_of_suit = []
        new_card = self.get_number()
        while len(number_of_suit) <= 12:
            if new_card in deck_of_cards:
                new_card = self.get_number()
            else:
                deck_of_cards.append(new_card)
                number_of_suit.append(str(self.suit))
 ```
